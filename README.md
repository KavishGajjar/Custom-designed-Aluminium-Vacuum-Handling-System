## üìã Project Overview

This project showcases the end-to-end development of a new vacuum material handling system, from conceptual design to final commissioning. Unlike previous projects focused on software optimization, this effort centered on the ground-up mechanical design and fabrication of the machine itself. The entire structure was custom-designed using a lightweight, modular aluminium extrusion frame, making it adaptable and efficient. I was responsible for the complete lifecycle, turning a concept into a fully operational, automated machine for Workwell Engineers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features & Design Highlights

* **Custom Mechanical Design:** The entire system frame was designed from scratch in SolidWorks, optimized for strength, weight, and ease of assembly.
* **Aluminium Extrusion Frame:** Utilizes T-slot aluminium profiles for a modular, rigid, and lightweight structure.
* **End-to-End Development:** Covers every stage from 3D CAD and 2D manufacturing drawings to physical assembly, wiring, and PLC programming.
* **Integrated Mechatronics:** Seamlessly combines mechanical movement, pneumatic actuation, sensor feedback, and intelligent PLC control.
* **Full Automation:** Programmed for a complete, autonomous pick-and-place cycle with integrated limit switches and sensors for precise positioning.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Full-Lifecycle Contributions

As the lead engineer, my responsibilities spanned the entire mechatronics spectrum:

* **Mechanical Design & Modeling:** Developed the complete 3D assembly of the machine in SolidWorks.
* **Technical Drawings:** Created detailed 2D manufacturing and assembly drawings using AutoCAD.
* **Fabrication & Assembly:** Led the hands-on construction of the machine, from cutting the aluminium sections to final mechanical assembly.
* **Electrical System Integration:** Designed the control panel layout, performed all electrical wiring, and installed all sensors and limit switches.
* **PLC Programming & Control:** Developed and commissioned the PLC logic to control the system's automated sequence.

## üíª Technology & Hardware Stack

* **Mechanical Design:** SolidWorks (3D), AutoCAD (2D)
* **Control System:** [Mention PLC Model, e.g., Siemens S7-200]
* **Programming:** Ladder Logic using [Mention Software, e.g., STEP 7 MicroWIN]
* **Core Hardware:**
    * T-Slot Aluminium Extrusion Profiles
    * Pneumatic Cylinders & Solenoid Valves
    * Vacuum Generator & Suction Grippers
    * Proximity Sensors & Mechanical Limit Switches

## üì∏ The Design & Build Process

## üí° Learning Outcomes

This project was a deep dive into practical mechatronics integration. A key challenge was translating the digital SolidWorks model into a precise, physically aligned machine, which required careful attention to fabrication tolerances. It solidified my skills in managing the entire engineering workflow, proving my ability to deliver a complete automated solution from a blank slate.
